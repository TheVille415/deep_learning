This is a classifier model. It is being trained to recognize the quality of the wine. In other words, is it good or bad wine?

For our model we are looking at the classes of the wine from 0-10. 0 meaning bad wine and 10 meaning the top wine.
The other variables are features that affect the outcome. These will help determine the relationship between the data.

In order to evaluate the model's performance I plotted the lost against the val_lost. This is shows that while training our model we are infasct getting a nice fit. There is some noise interference but near the end of the training it seems to be fitting very close to what we are working with.
